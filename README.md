## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

- **Emotion-Aware Feedback** â€“ Detects learner emotions (e.g., joy, frustration) using logistic regression on TF-IDF.
- **Cognitive Tier Detection** â€“ Classifies input into Bloomâ€™s levels (1â€“6) to gauge depth of understanding.
- **SEF Scoring** â€“ Computes semantic similarity between learner input and expected objectives.
- **SBERT SEF Option** â€“ Supports cosine similarity with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for richer embeddings.
- **Structured Logging** â€“ Captures inputs, predictions, responses, and scores in `logs/logs.csv`.
- **Easy to Extend** â€“ Swap models, integrate LLMs, or update objectives without retraining everything.
